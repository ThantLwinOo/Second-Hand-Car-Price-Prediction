# Second hand car price prediction 

This project focuses on predicting the price of second-hand cars using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a used car based on the important features.

# Dataset

Dataset consists of the following features:

- Name

- Year

- Selling Price

- Driven km

- Fuel

- Seller Type

- Transmission

- Owner

- Milage

- Engine

- Max Power

- Seats

# Data Preprocessing

- Drop null values and duplicat rows

- Plot histogram and log the data

- Scattar Plot

- Encode Categorical Data

- Extract important features according to the correaltion matrix

- Train/Test split(80-20)
